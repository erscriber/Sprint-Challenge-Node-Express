- Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

		Middleware and routing.

- Describe Middleware?

		Middleware is a software layer situated between applications and operating systems.

- Describe a Resource?

		According to REST, everything the API needs to handle is a resource.

- What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

		A 200 code indicates the client's request was accepted successfully.

- How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

		We can use Express Router to create modular route handlers to navigate to the resources.
